1. Copy and paste the custom folder into your misson.map.pbo
	(if you already have a custom folder in your mission.map.pbo then just copy and paste the SeventhFleetSpawn.sqf file into your custome folder.)
	
2. copy the code below into your init.sqf located in your mission.map.pbo
	[] execVM "custom\SeventhFleetSpawn.sqf";
	
To change where the Carrier and Destroyers spawn in at, you will need to get the chordinates and put them in for each one

Line 4 is for the Carrier and looks like this..... private _obj = ["Land_Carrier_01_base_F", [1510, 27224.2, 0], [-0.776351, -0.630301, 0], [0, 0, 1], true];
[1510, 27224.2, 0] in this line of code is the only thing you need to change for a new location to spawn, you can leave the last number at 0.

Now you need to change the Destroyer locations as well located on lines 47, 69, 91, and 113.

To change the direction they are all facing you need to change each line that looks like this.......... _vehicle setDir 129.072;
129.072 in this line of code is the direction in degrees.
